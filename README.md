# genesis
A library of data structures in multiple file formats that structures the taxonomy of the Plant Kingdom.

# How it works?
So far, there is only a JSON file, but eventually there will be XML and YAML.

# Why do this?
This is aimed at anyone who wants to add a taxonomy structure to a data science project. I have found very few resources online that has the data available in such formats.

# How accurate is the taxonomy?
This is a great question that many Botanists have been debating for generations. There is still a lot of debate about the family trees of the Plant Kingdom (pun intended) so it is very challenging to create a taxonomy of high accuracy.

So, instead I have gone only by what is so far what is currently known. I will have a text file called "sources.txt" that will record all references to the relevent information. There are also attributes within the data structures or comments that reflect any debates or inaccuracies within the plant families. Beware, there are many debates.

# If I find an error, what do I do?
Just try to contact me and I'll fix it up. Also, give me a reference to where the information is as well.
