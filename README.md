# genesis
A library of data structures in multiple file formats that structures the taxonomy of the Plant Kingdom.

# How it works?
So far, there is only a JSON file, but eventually there will be XML and YAML.

# Why do this?
This is aimed at anyone who wants to add a taxonomy structure to a data science project.
